# TINET Backend
This is the TINET backend, a project I made to have internet on my calculator but is completely useless at this point.  
It's slow, bad website and not stable.

I might come back with a better version written in another language which will have a completely different name and model.

I decided to make this project open source to warn other devs out here that Django is BAD. Use Go instead, you will write more but it is faster, better sync-async manipulation and a waaay better garbage collector.

If you were using TINET, thanks.
